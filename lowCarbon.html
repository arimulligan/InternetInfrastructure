										<h3 class="major">Why Low Carbon?</h3>
										<br>A low carbon web design approach is poised to become increasingly important in the design profession in the 
											near future. As sustainability concerns continue to grow, designers will be expected to take a more 
											environmentally responsible approach to their work. Low carbon web design not only aligns with these 
											emerging environmental values but also addresses the practicality of creating faster, more efficient, 
											and accessible websites. 
											<br> </br>
											Moreover, as regulatory and consumer demands for eco-conscious practices rise, 
											designers who embrace low carbon principles will likely have a competitive edge in the marketplace. 
											Therefore, it is my opinion that low carbon web design is not just a sustainable choice but also a 
											strategic one for the design profession as it navigates the challenges of a changing world.

										<div class="table-wrapper">
											<table class="alt">
												<thead>
													<tr>
														<th>Technique</th>
														<th>Why?</th>
													</tr>
												</thead>
												<tbody>
													<tr>
														<td>Dithered Images</td>
														<td>The use of dithered images is beneficial for low carbon web design because it 
															helps reduce the file size of images while maintaining visual quality, ultimately 
															leading to lower energy consumption and a smaller carbon footprint. Dithering is a 
															technique that adds noise or patterns to images, allowing for the representation of 
															more colors and details with fewer pixels. This results in smaller image files, which 
															require less bandwidth and storage space, thereby decreasing the data transfer and server 
															energy consumption associated with serving images to users. In a world where image-heavy 
															websites can be resource-intensive, dithering contributes to a more energy-efficient and 
															environmentally responsible web design approach.
															<br> </br>
															I used a color palette size of 6 using the Floyd Steinberg dithering method. 
														</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Default Typeface / No Logo</td>
														<td>Utilizing default typefaces and forgoing logos in low carbon web design is a strategic choice 
															for a more sustainable and efficient online presence. These design decisions prioritize reduced 
															load times and minimal bandwidth usage by relying on web-safe fonts already available on users' devices, 
															resulting in faster page loading and decreased energy consumption associated with data transfer. The 
															simplicity and clarity of such a design enhance the overall user experience while reducing maintenance 
															overhead. This approach not only demonstrates environmental responsibility but also ensures cross-device 
															compatibility, aligning perfectly with the principles of a greener and more accessible web.
															<br> </br>
															I did this by deleting the whole package of web fonts that was in this HTML5Up template, and deleting all occurances of 'font-family'.
															I then deleted all the favicons and the links in the headers for each of these things.
														</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>No Third-Party Tracking, No Advertising Services, No Cookies</td>
														<td>A web design approach that excludes third-party tracking, advertising services, and cookies offers numerous 
															benefits: including enhanced privacy, faster loading times, simplified user experience, lower resource 
															consumption, improved security, compliance with privacy regulations, and sustainability. By avoiding 
															these elements, websites can foster trust, reduce data breaches, and improve user experience. This approach 
															also reduces energy consumption and operational costs, ensuring a more predictable and secure browsing experience. 
															Furthermore, it contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally responsible internet, reducing energy 
															consumption for data transmission.
															<br> </br>
															I did this by not letting any third parties put advertising, or install any plugins for the website which could track their movements. 
															I have no cookies in this website because the website does not need to know who the user is.
														</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Dark Coloured Design</td>
														<td>Because the more dark you go, the less energy the computer will have to use for brightness, so a more sustainable outcome for each of the users.</td>
